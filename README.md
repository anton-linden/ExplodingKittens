# Exploding Kittens by Anton Lindén

## About the project
This is a university home exam in the course [D7032E](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/D70/D7032E/D7032E-Programvaruteknik-1.112678?kursView=kursplan&l=en) at [Luleå tekniska universitet](https://www.ltu.se/). I was given code that didn't follow good coding practices and was overall a messy project. The goal of the project was to introduce design patterns if found necessary and to apply good coding practices & principals.
